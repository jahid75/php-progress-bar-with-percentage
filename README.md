# PHP Progress Bar With Percentage

A very simple way to show progress bar with percentage for long running php scripts. You can use this as PHP csv import progress bar or any other server side php progress bar. I've used only PHP and JavaScript (Ajax and SSE)

**To Test it:**

- You need a PHP based web server to test this script.
- First clone this repository into your local/remote server: `git clone https://github.com/jahid75/php-progress-bar-with-percentage.git php-progress`
- Now run it in your browser. Example: `http://localhost/php-progress`
